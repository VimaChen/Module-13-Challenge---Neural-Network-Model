# Module-13-Challenge---Neural-Network-Model

## Background 

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The Alphabet Soup business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Instruction
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

* Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model

* Compile and Evaluate a Binary Classification Model by Using a Neural Network

* Optimise the Neural Network Model

## Result

I compared the original model and also 2 alternative models by assigning different number of input feathers, different number of neurons on each layer, and also the different epochs.

Original Model Results
268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5574 - accuracy: 0.7291 - 194ms/epoch - 726us/step
Loss: 0.5574021339416504, Accuracy: 0.7290962338447571

Alternative Model 1 Results
268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5585 - accuracy: 0.7304 - 282ms/epoch - 1ms/step
Loss: 0.558506429195404, Accuracy: 0.7303789854049683

Alternative Model 2 Results
268/268 - 0s - loss: 0.5634 - accuracy: 0.7305 - 308ms/epoch - 1ms/step
Loss: 0.5633548498153687, Accuracy: 0.7304956316947937

We can find the loss and accuracy are pretty similar.
